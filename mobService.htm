                         User Experience (UX) is the lasting 
                         feeling a user will have after visiting your site.
                          
                         So this is my first priority as a developer.   
                         I'll work with Photoshop and Illustrator to create static visuals of
                          your site and get them to a point where you're happy...!

                         When you're happy with the designs,
                         I'll work on your project using the most suitable technology.
                         I hand-code using Responsive HTML5, CSS, jQuery 
                         and PHP. I'm also a big advocate of
                          responsive design - that's catering for people viewing your site on smartphones and tablets.

                         It's no good having a fantastic website if no one knows out there.
                         I'll work on your SEO to optimise your site to be as search engine-friendly as possible.

                         I can help you run a successful pay-per-click advertising 
                         campaign using Google Adwords.
